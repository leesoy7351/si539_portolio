            Hi! I am Soyoung, a 2nd year Masterâ€™s student in School of Information at University of Michigan. My research interests are Human Computer Interaction, Social Computing, Skill development, Community Development and Future of Work. I am training myself with mixed methods and community-based participatory design for my research. Currently I am working as a research assistant at <a href='http://socialinnovations.us/'>Social Innovation Group</a> a with Dr. Twanna Dillihaunt. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a product/project manager in business for 6 years.
		</p>
		<p>I am studying Human Computer Interaction in the University of Michigan School of Information. I study the role and (unintended) effects of technology in our lives, and hope to design healthier, more equitable design for people. Currently I am investigating graduate studentâ€™s social life during the pandemic when all the classes were abruptly forced to go online for my independent study. 
						</p>
		<p>I am from South Korea. I spent most of my 20s studying and working in Seoul. Itâ€™s a vibrant city where I can recommend tons of yummy foods and some cool places that have a mix of traditional and modern vibes. You can see the pictures of some of my favorite (hidden) places in Seoul on this website. I love eating crispy (and spicy) fried chickens with BEER along the Han-river that flows across the city.</p>
