        <h2>A Collective Approach to Providing Digital Skills Training Among Lay Community Members</h2>
		<p><img src="images/community.png" alt="community_project" class="float-left"> </p>
        <p class="index">
		            The digital divide is a social inequality and challenge among low-income communities in the US (Vogels, 2021) that spans beyond access to devices and Internet connection. Digital skills training to access essential Internet-based resources like healthcare, employment and education, is still necessary (Deursen & Dijk, 2011). The recent COVID-19 pandemic aggravated the problem, especially among resource-constrained communities and seniors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, this project focus on (1) a community-based participatory research collaboration between a university team and non-profit, which involved curating and coordinating online courses with offline peer-support to provide digital training among 9 community members to serve as intermediaries who provide community digital support, and (2) the outcomes of the digital skills training among them. Community-member trainees increased self-efficacy in digital skills, were able to apply for basic resources, gained employment at the non-profit and have begun to provide digital support within the community. Our findings suggest a potential model for community social learning and basic digital skill development, and contributes to minimizing barriers of online learning, especially among traditionally excluded populations (Dillahunt et al., 2014; Escueta et al., 2017). 
        </p>

		<p>Our survey results show increased self-efficacy in learning digital skills. In the final presentation of the training, one team member said in reference to receiving and providing team support:  </p>
